We’ll go over each one, and how to solder them in place.\n     Screw Terminal In your connector bag you’ll find a screw terminal connector. This provides power to the machine, and goes into the J12 footprint on the upper-right corner of the board. Ensure that the openings that accept the power cables are facing outwards.\n  IDC Connectors The IDC connectors are the larger, black connectors in your connector bag. There are only two sizes, a 2x3 for feeder communication, and three 2x6 for the auxillary ports. Be sure to solder them the correct orientation. The slot on the connector should match up with the silkscreen.\n     JST XH Connectors The bulk of the connectors on the board are JST XH connectors. These come in two, three, and four pin variations. The two pin connectors are for the mosfets, the three pin connectors are for the servos, limit switches, and ring lights, and the four pin connectors are for the stepper motors.\nWARNING The 4-pin JST XH connector for the Y2 motor (the one right next to the Y silkscreen indicator) needs to be rotated 180 degrees from what the silkscreen dictates. This one should be soldered in reverse, opposite of the silkscreen indication. Refer to the image below for reference.           USB A Connectors There are three USB A connectors that need to be soldered into the board as well. Two of these are for the webcams, and the third is for future functionality. We recommend soldering the large structural tabs in place first, then soldering the four data pins afterward.\n  Stepper Motor Driver Headers The last connectors that need to be soldered into the board are the 1x8 Dupont 0.1\" headers for the stepper motor drivers. Two connectors need to be soldered for each driver. We recommend soldering a single pin in place first while getting the connector to stay flat, then do the rest of the pins after the orientation is solidified. Orientation does not matter for these connectors.\n  Next steps Continue to mounting the motherboard.\n","categories":"","description":"Instructions about how to install the THT components into a LumenPnP Motherboard","excerpt":"Instructions about how to install the THT components into a LumenPnP …","ref":"/docs/motherboard/installing-tht/","tags":"","title":"Install THT Components"},{"body":"This guide is for installing the Vacuum Sensor Interposer Boards. Some early units of the LumenPnP shipped with a standard vacuum sensor on the motherboard that has a signal swing of a few hundred units. Because of some variability in the components used, this swing can be too small to get a usable signal for vacuum part-pick detection. This installation makes the signal swing much larger, making it easier to get a usable signal from the sensor.\nWe’re sorry about this! In our internal testing of this feature, we found that the swing was large enough to detect a missed pick accurately, but we didn’t test comprehensively enough to ensure it was always the case for every board. We’ve changed the way we test features before boards leave our facility to catch these types of issues.\nHelp If you at any time run into trouble or are unsure of how to proceed with this guide, please reach out to our customer support line and we’ll get you up and running.  Timing This process should take about 60 minutes.\nTools Needed  Hot Air Gun Soldering Iron Tweezers Solder Solder Wick 2x Interposer PCBAs Your REV03 Motherboard       Installation   First, you’ll need to remove the existing vacuum sensors. You’ll find them near the USB-C connector labeled “VAC1” and “VAC2”. If your board looks like the image below, then you do not have the interposers installed and this guide is for you! If your vacuum sensors have a little green board between them and the motherboard, you’re all set and don’t need to perform this installation.\nUsing your hot air gun, apply heat to the legs of one of the vacuum sensors on your motherboard. Wait until you see the solder become molten and shiny, then gently remove the sensor from the PCB using tweezers. Perform the same operation for the second sensor.\n           Warning Be careful not to tug too hard on the sensor. It’s held down to the PCB with just a few copper pads, and pulling too hard might result in lifting those pads off the PCB. Make sure the solder is completely molten and the sensor should come away easily.  Remove any remaining solder on the vacuum sensor pads. The pads need to be cleaned and flat for the interposer installation. Use solder wick (and flux if necessary) to remove any solder from the six pads that make up each vacuum sensor footprint. Clean up any excess flux or solder residue.    Now you can install an interposer board. First, make sure you have the correct board orientation. The bottom of the board has six pads that match the vacuum sensor footprint on the board. Make sure they line up with the footprint and that a bit of the interposer board is hanging off of the edge of the motherboard.       Correct orientation\n  Make sure the six pads of the footprint on the motherboard align with the six plated edges of the interposer board.\n  Add a bit of solder to one of the pads on the motherboard, and tack the interposer in place with a bit of solder on one of the pads. Apply heat to this joint while you align the interposer board using your tweezers.       Once your board is aligned with the pads and tacked in place, apply solder to the remaining five pads. Make sure that you have a good fillet of solder connecting the interposer board to the pad on the motherboard.       Repeat steps 4 and 5 with the second interposer board and the second vacuum footprint on the motherboard.          Check to make sure that the sensor is working properly. Connect to the motherboard with your computer and try sending some GCode commands to it with a GCode sender. We recommend using CNCjs.\n First sensor command: M3426 G2 C1 I1 A110 Second sensor command: M3426 G2 C2 I1 A110  When at ambient pressure, the response from each sensor should look something like this:\nV:29800 C:1 G:2 I:1 Make sure the V value is about 29800. Don’t worry if it’s not exact. As long as it’s within 500 of 29800, it’s an acceptable value.\nIf both sensors return an acceptable value, proceed to the next step.\n  Next, check the sensor readings when connected to the pneumatic system. Push the vacuum line onto the VAC1 sensor. Install the N045 nozzle tip onto the nozzle. Next, turn on the pump for nozzle 1 and its valve using these commands:\nM106 ;turn on pump 1 M106 P1 S255 ;turn on valve 1 With the pump and valve on, read the pressure from the first vacuum sensor:\nM3426 G2 C1 I1 A110 You should read a value of about 15500. Don’t worry if it’s not exact. As long as it’s within 13000 - 18000, it’s an acceptable value. Record this number.\nNow, cover the tip of the nozzle with your finger and re-run the command. Make sure the pump and valve are still running. Record this number. Turn off the pump and valve using the following commands:\nM107 ;turn off the pump M107 P1 ;turn off the valve   Remove the vacuum tube from VAC1 and install it onto VAC2.\n  Repeat step 8 again to check the second sensor. You’ll need to use M3426 G2 C2 I1 A110 to read the pressure from the second sensor instead of the first.\n  Remove the vacuum tube from VAC2 and install it onto VAC1.\n  If the value when the nozzle was covered was around 2000 less than the uncovered value for both sensors, then your installation is complete! If not, re-assess the soldering joints of the interposer board onto the motherboard and make sure they’re all connected with a solid joint. If you are still unable to get a good reading, please reach out to our support line and we’ll make sure you get up and running.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Install interposer boards on your REV03 Motherboard\n","excerpt":"Install interposer boards on your REV03 Motherboard\n","ref":"/maintenance-upgrades/rev3-vac-interposer/","tags":"","title":"REV03 Motherboard Interposer Installation Guide"},{"body":"Placements Offset in the Same Direction  Crashed Toolhead Incorrect Toolhead Offset Bad Fiducial Scan Check Board Location  Parts Not Picking  Incorrect Feeder Z Position Incorrect Toolhead Offset Paste In Nozzle Tip Pick Dwell Time Too Short Loose Pulley Belt Tension Check Vacuum Pump  Parts Not Placing  Board Z Height Incorrect Place Dwell Time Too Short Replace your double-sided tape or try fresh solder paste  Parts Rotated Incorrectly  Bottom Vision Error Brass Nozzle Holder Loose  Some placements are consistently better than others  Check Board Rotation  Inconsistent Positioning  Loose Pulley Belt Tension Check Endstops Check Staging Plate  Top Camera not positioning over homing fiducial  Loose Pulley Belt Tension Check Endstops Check Staging Plate  Cameras Don’t Connect  USB Hub Overload  Z Axis Won’t Jog  Camera Drop-Down Selected  Components not rotated correctly on the board  Check your vision pipeline Check that your nozzle holder is on tight Check that your nozzle is fully seated and lubricated  Tool head doesn’t move correctly when jogging from the camera feed  Loose Pulley Belt Tension Check Endstops Check Fisheye Calibration  Components not recognized by bottom camera  Bottom Vision Error  ","categories":"","description":"Symptoms\n","excerpt":"Symptoms\n","ref":"/troubleshooting/symptoms/","tags":"","title":"Symptoms"},{"body":"   Qty Part     1 Y1 Cable Harness (Labeled Y1)   1 Y2 Cable Harness (Labeled Y2)   4 Zip Tie   4 FDM-0016 (Cable Clip)   3 FDM-0023 (Cable Clamp)   3 M3x14 machine screw   3 M3 Hex Nut    The left and right Y motors are connected to the motherboard using the cable harnesses Y1 and Y2, respectively.

Each will need its own feeder so that the LumenPnP can pick each type of component. For this guide, you’ll use printed tray feeders.\nAttach Feeders   Use two M3x10 button head screws and two M3 wingnuts to secure the printed tray feeder through onto the staging plate using holes: C11 and E11.     For each component, cut a strip of component tape off the reel about 125mm long.\n  Slide the Resistors into the left-most tray feeder, and the LEDs the adjacent tray.\n  In OpenPnP, connect to your LumenPnP and home it.

Select ReferenceTrayFeeder and click Accept.     In the lower-right panel, you’ll be in the Configuration tab. Change the Part to be R_0603_1608Metric-R_Small.     Set the Y Offset to -4. This is the space between components on the tape.     Set the Y Tray Count to 30. This is the number of components available on the feeder before it needs to be manually moved forward.     Set the Pick location to: X=45, Y=175, Z=20 as a starting point.     Click on the “Position Camera” icon button to move the top camera roughly over the left feeder.     Position the center of the top camera feed over the center of the top-most slot holding a resistor in the tray. You can drag the reticle in the camera feed, or use the jog buttons.     Zoom in on the camera feed and precisely position the center of the reticle over the center of the slot holding the resistor. The resistor itself may not be perfectly centered, that is fine.

Try jogging to your homing fiducial and see if the camera is centered on it (Found under Machine Setup -\u003e Heads -\u003e ReferenceHead H1 and clicking on the “Jog camera to position” button next to the Homing Fiducal coordinates). If not, it’s likely that the machine has skipped steps. Rehome the machine to solve this issue. You can set soft limits in the Machine Setup \u003e Axes menus.\nIncorrect Toolhead Offset If the offset of the nozzle tip to the top camera is set incorrectly, the machine will place parts slightly offset from where they should be and may not pick them up correctly. Redo the Nozzle Offset Calibration to solve this issue. You may also tweak the values manually in OpenPnP under Machine Setup -\u003e Heads -\u003e ReferenceHead H1 -\u003e Nozzles -\u003e ReferenceNozzle N1 -\u003e Offset Wizard -\u003e Nozzle head offsets.\nBad Fiducial Scan It’s possible that when OpenPnP scans for the fiducials on your PCB, it actually found a bright section of silkscreen or another pad, and that shifted all the placements on your board. Rerun your fiducial scan and check to see if OpenPnP is correctly finding the fiducial. Instructions for tuning a vision pipeline for fiducials can be found here.\nIncorrect Feeder Z Position Picking can sometimes fail if the nozzle is either too far away from the part, or too close. Jog your nozzle tip about 1mm above a part in your feeder, and turn on the PV actuator to activate the vacuum. Now, slowly jog the Z axis down 0.1mm until you see the part jump onto the tip, and hear the pump strain against the vacuum. Jog one final 0.1mm down after this, and set your feeder Z position to your current Z position.\nPaste In Nozzle Tip Sometimes the nozzle tip may dip into a bit of solder paste on your PCB. This can cause a blockage and prevent a part from being picked correctly. If you’re finding that parts refuse to stick to your nozzle, try checking the nozzle tip for a blockage and clear it out with some small gauge wire, or some pressurized air.\nPick Dwell Time Too Short If OpenPnP does not give the machine enough time to pull a proper vacuum and grab the part before moving the nozzle tip away from the pick location, the part can fail to pick. Try increasing the pick dwell time for the nozzle tip you’re using under Machine Setup -\u003e Nozzle Tips -\u003e ReferenceNozzleTip N__ -\u003e Dwell Times -\u003e Pick Dwell Time\nPlace Dwell Time Too Short If OpenPnP does not give the machine enough time to release the vacuum and drop the part onto the board before moving the nozzle tip away from the place location, the part can fail to place. Try increasing the place dwell time for the nozzle tip you’re using under Machine Setup -\u003e Nozzle Tips -\u003e ReferenceNozzleTip N__ -\u003e Dwell Times -\u003e Place Dwell Time\nBoard Z Height Incorrect If the Board Z Height is set too high, the nozzle will not press the part firmly into the solder paste which helps it stay in place. Try tuning your board’s Z position by bring it down in 0.1mm increments and testing placements between each tweak to see if parts are being pushed into the paste more firmly.\nBrass Nozzle Holder Loose If not tightened into the motor properly, sometimes the brass nozzle holder can come loose and cause incorrect placements. Ensure that your nozzle holder is tightened into the hollow shaft stepper motor tightly.\nLoose Pulley Check the pulleys attached to each motor for play. While the machine is powered and homed, try pushing or pulling on the X, Y, and Z axes. If the axis can be moved by hand back and forth without causing the motor to skip steps, then the pulley on that axis probably needs to be tightened down onto the motor shaft.\n Power off the LumenPnP Loosen the belt tension for the axis you’re working on Remove the motor from its mount Check that the pulley is fully secured Tighten the grub screws holding the pulley on the motor shaft Reinstall the motor Re-tighten the timing belt Power on the LumenPnP Home the machine Make sure that the play in that axis is gone.  Belt Tension If the nozzle or camera is failing to repeatably move to the same position, it’s likely that one of your timing belts do not have sufficient tension. Check the belt tensioner arms on the X and both Y axis and ensure they’re tight, and difficult to pull away from the machine any further.\nUSB Hub Overload Some computers' internal USB controllers are unable to process a webcam feed from both webcams through the same USB port. If you are unable to get both webcams to appear in OpenPnP, try unplugging one from the motherboard and plugging it directly into your computer. For more information about this, check out the camera testing section of the assembly instructions.\nCamera Drop-Down Selected If you’re finding that trying to manually jog the Z axis of your machine does not work, check the drop-down in the “Machine Controls” section of the UI underneath the cameras, and select the Nozzle instead of the Camera. This should allow you to jog your Z axis.\nBottom Vision Error If the bottom vision pipeline for your part is not set up correctly, it might find the outline of the part to be larger, smaller, or offset from what it actually is, causing an incorrect placement. The homing fiducial vision calibration is helpful for seeing how to tune a vision pipeline, but also check out OpenPnP’s bottom vision wiki page to help tune your pipeline.\nCheck Vacuum Pump  Press down on the quick connect coupler P Pull out the plastic tubing from your tool head. Turn on the vacuum pump Turn on the valve Put your finger over the end of the tubing If you can’t feel suction:  You may have a leak in the tubing You may have wired your pump or valve incorrectly Your valve or pump may be damaged, check the noises they make    Check Board Rotation  Re-run the board fiducials Check various placement locations by moving the camera over them to make sure they’re set correctly. If the placement locations are NOT lining up with the reticle in the camera feed:  Adjust your board fiducial pipeline, Or manually set your board’s location and position with “set board location with multiple placements” icon button.   If the placement locations DO line up with the reticle in the camera feed:  Check your nozzle offset Check your part identification vision pipeline (unlikely) Check for backlash and other mechanical issues with your motion system.    Check Endstops Check for something obstructing your end stops or triggering them early\nCheck Staging Plate If your staging plate comes loose, all of your locations defined in OpenPnP will start to be incorrect. Your machine may fail to home because it won’t be able to find the homing fiducial. And it’ll have trouble consistently picking components from the feeder. And it will probably place components in the wrong place on the PCB.\n Tighten all four screws holding the staging plate in place Reset your homing fiducial location Reset your feeder locations Reset your board location  Check mm to Pixel Calibration Redo the steps in mm/pixel Calibration\nCheck fisheye calibration Redo the steps in Camera Fisheye Calibration\nCheck Board Location Go to the list of placements and position the top camera over a few of them. If they’re all offset a little bit, your board location is probably incorrect.

The idea is to have you follow simple test steps to show the problem in limited situations so you have fewer possible root causes to check and solve.\nMotion System Check The LumenPnP uses a lot of different offsets and calibrations for using its cameras to make precise movements. This test ignores those, and only tests the physical motion system of the machine.\n Jog the machine until the top camera is positioned somewhere recognizable, such as over a feeder. This will be your starting point. Next, pick another recognizable location as a target destination. For example, pick one of the component locations on your board. Make sure that neither of the locations you picked require that you click a button in OpenPnP that uses the cameras to find fiducial markers. We want to avoid that during this test. Move the machine back and forth between these two locations at least 5 times. Note which axes move: X, Y, and or Z.  If the machine correctly travels repeatably to these two locations each time, then your motion system is likely healthy. The test has succeeded.\nIf the machine does NOT correctly travel to these two locations repeatably, then something is wrong with your motion system. Check the following:\n Check the X, Y, Z axis belt tension Check the X, Y, Z axis motor pulleys to make sure they’re not loose Check the stepper motors to make sure they’re not overheating Check that the top camera isn’t loose Check that the staging plate isn’t loose Check that the tool head isn’t crashing to reach one of the jog locations  Toolhead offset check Incorrect tool head offsets will cause pick and place operations to fail. This test tunes the tool head offset directly without any use of computer vision or the cameras themselves. It is recommended to run the Motion System Check first before this test to rule out motion system repeatability issues first.\n Load one of your tray feeders Position the camera over the feeder location Switch to positioning the nozzle over the feeder location Look at the nozzle and see if it’s position is in line with what you saw on the camera feed in step 2 If not, adjust the toolhead offset by 0.05mm at a time. Repeat from step 2 until the nozzle location is consistent with what you could see from the camera.

Qwertymodo Full Calibration Video\n Community member Qwertymodo has put together a video of doing his calibration from scratch, instead of using the OpenPnP config files in the repository as a starting point. Many folks in the community have found it very useful, especially for understanding all the menus and features OpenPnP has to offer.

If you follow these steps you will have a slightly easier time setting the location of the board in OpenPnP, but if you need to set up a board somewhere else on the staging plates, that is totally fine, too.\n  Loosely screw in the universal mounting components in the following locations:\n Static Board Mount positioned diagonally, screwed into B28 Dynamic Board Mount positioned vertically, screwed into D28 Dynamic Board Mount positioned horizontally, screwed into B30 Board Support placed in E31       Cut strips of double-sided tape and apply them to the top of the FTP board. Do not cover the fiducial markers, but make sure that each of the pads are covered by tape. The double-sided tape lets the components stick to the board so that you can do a “mock” run of a placement job without dealing with solder paste.     Place the FTP board in the holders and push them so that they’re snug against the sides of the board.     Tighten down the holders. You shouldn’t be able to move the board except by pressing on the tab holding it in place.\n  If you installed your holders in this location, the bottom left corner of your FTP board should be located around X328, Y94.\n  Finding the FTP Board Location The next step is to set the physical location of the FTP board in OpenPNP. You’ll start by setting an approximate location and then fine tune the location using vision. Once the location is set, you can run the job to pick and place components. You’ll likely need to go through these steps a few times to tune the settings.\n Navigate to the Job tab in the top-right pane.     In the bottom-right pane, you’ll see the Placements panel. Find the three elements with the IDs: FID1, FID2, and FID3. You can sort the list by Part to find them easily.     For each of the three elements, go to the Type column, select where it says Placement and switch it to Fiducial. This tells OpenPnP that these three elements on the board are not components to be picked and placed, but fiducials to be scanned.     Back in the top-right pane, double-click on the X and Y values of 0.000 and change them to X328 and Y94 respectively. This will be the rough location of the bottom-left corner of the FTP board.     Get the Z axis coordinate used when setting up the feeders, subtract 0.10 from it, and enter the result into the Z coordinate for the board. Setting the Z slightly lower than the actual board height allows the spring-loaded nozzle holder to lightly press components into the board to make them stick.     Click the “Position Camera on Board” icon button and check that the center of the camera feed is very roughly lined up with the bottom-left corner of the FTP board.     In the lower-right pane, select one of the fiducials to highlight it.     Click the “Position Camera” icon button to move the top camera over the fiducial location.     The alignment will probably not be perfect. To fix this, click on the digital readout in the bottom right corner to zero your current position.     Then, move the tool head with the Jog buttons until the fiducial is centered in the reticle.     Read the relative XY position you’ve moved your tool head, and add those values to the board’s X and Y positions. Do not change the position of the fiducial itself in the lower-right pane list as that will throw off the rest of the placements. Only adjust the location of the board itself, not the components relative to each other.     In the lower-right panel, select the other fiducial points in turn, and check their location with the “position camera” icon button.     If all the fiducials are close to the reticle center, you’re ready to run a fiducial scan to get the exact location of your FTP board. If only the first fiducial is centered, your board is probably rotated (ie the bottom edge is not parallel with the X axis). You can still move on to the fiducial scan, but you may need to manually readjust the board so that it is straighter.\n  Click on the “Fiducial Scan for Location” button. This will automatically move the camera to each of the fiducial locations and use the camera to try to identify the center of the fiducial. If it can find all three, it will automatically update the position and rotation of the board relative to the LumenPnP gantry.     If the fiducial check fails, here are some options for moving forward:\n You might need to rotate the FTP board to be more square to the LumenPnP motion system. You may need to adjust your vision pipeline. If you’d prefer, you can also fall back on manually defining the board’s location using the “Multiple Placements” icon button.       To double-check the board’s location, you can repeat step 17. It is also useful to select some of the other placement locations and move the camera to them as well to check that the camera is centered between the metal pads. If the camera is not lining up correctly, see Troubleshooting for help getting things more tightly set up.\n  Placing Components  Make sure you’ve pulled back the protective tape cover on your feeders and that you have the correct nozzle installed.\n  It’s time to place your first component. Press the “Single job step” icon button repeatedly until OpenPnP moves to pick up an LED, check it’s orientation over the bottom camera, and then places it on the board.     If the component was not picked up correctly, you will need to adjust your feeder location or height.\n  If the component was not identified by the bottom camera correctly, you will likely need to adjust its vision pipeline.\n  If the component did not stick to the FTP board, you should lower the FTP board’s Z axis location (0.10mm increments are a good starting place).\n  If the component stuck to the FTP board but was not centered on placement location (on the metal pads), you will need to do some fine tuning. It is useful to place five or so components before attempting to diagnose exactly what’s wrong with your placements.\n  Continue to click the “Single Job Step” to place the additional components (or click the “Play” icon button and pause the operation when you’re ready.)\n  It is perfectly normal for your very first set of component placements to have some errors. There are several different sources of placement error that we can address, one at a time. It will take a little trial and error to get placements perfect. Go to the Troubleshooting page for easy instructions.\n","categories":"","description":"Configuring and running the job\n","excerpt":"Configuring and running the job\n","ref":"/openpnp/ftp/setting-up-the-board/","tags":"","title":"Setting up the FTP Board"},{"body":"Getting The Part Models Alright, time to get the parts we need to print! You can find the parts you need on the Releases Page, and look at the attached Assets at the bottom of the release. Click and download both LumenPnP-STLs and LumenPnP-BOM to get the STL files and BOM for your machine.\nPrinter Requirements These parts are designed to fit onto a printer with a build volume of at least 18 x 18 x 18 cm, such as the Prusa MINI. Although not recommended, it’s possible to print the parts on a smaller printer with some creative placements.\nAdditionally these parts are designed for printers with a 0.4mm nozzle. Using a larger nozzle diameter can result in some features not resolving correctly, or parts not fitting as designed.\nMaterial These parts are designed for PLA, however, some folks have printed the parts successfully with PETG. You’ll need about 1 kg of the primary filament.\nThere are three situations where you’ll need specific filament colors:\n White or transparent filament for the light mounts, top-light-mount and bottom-light-mount. These parts act as light diffusers for the ring lights. White or light colored filament for the nozzle-rack. This helps with setting up the automatic tool changer. A darker filament for the Z gantries, z-gantry-left and z-gantry-right. This helps the bottom camera distinguish the nozzle tip from the rest of the gantry. If you print in a lighter color anyway you can use a bit of blue painter’s table on the bottom side of the gantry.  Print settings There are two different print setting profiles you’ll need for printing the parts. We use PrusaSlicer’s setting names, but you should be able to adapt them if you use a different slicer. Every printer is a little different, but these settings should be a reasonable starting point. You can tune them as needed once you print the calibration print in the next step.\nDefault Settings These settings are used for the majority of the parts:\n Layer height: 0.2 mm Vertical shells \u003e Perimeters: 3 Infill \u003e Fill density: 20% Horizontal shells \u003e Solid Layers: 5 for top and bottom Support material \u003e Generate support material: yes  Gantry Settings These settings are used for parts that require more strength:\n Layer height: 0.2 mm Vertical shells \u003e Perimeters: 4 Infill \u003e Fill density: 30% Horizontal shells \u003e Solid Layers: 5 for top and bottom Support material \u003e Generate support material: yes  Use gantry settings for the following parts:\n y-gantry y-gantry-support roller-spacer x-gantry-front x-gantry-back x-idler-mount z-gantry-left z-gantry-right  Calibration Print Before printing the parts, print the calibration part. This part contains every feature- screw holes, nut slots, extrusion profiles, etc.- used in the printable parts. Printing this first ensures your printer calibration and print settings are correct.\n  This is the calibration print, colloquially referred to as “the corndog.\". This part isn’t currently included in the exported STLs, so grab it from the link above.\nAfter printing, you can check fit of various fasteners and one of the aluminum extrusions to ensure the parts you print will all fit as expected:\n Check that M3 and M5 bolts fit through their counter-sunk holes. Check that M3 and M5 nuts fit in both hexagonal voids and vertical nut slots. Check that M3 and M5 bolts can be self-tap through the two holes inside the lock icon. They should take some effort, but they should grip well into the print. Check that the 20 x 20 mm aluminum extrusion fits into the square hole.  Once you’re happy with the fit you can start printing the parts.\nPrinting The Parts   You can find out how many of each part to print in the LumenPnP-BOM zip file you downloaded in the first step. After unzipping, open the HTML file in your browser to see the machine’s Bill of Materials.\nThe “Part Name” column will tell you which part to print and the “Quantity” column will tell you how many to print. There’s a rendered image of each 3D printed part as well to help identify them. Just print the parts that have the “Part Type” of “FDM”. The other items in this table are a list of all the other fasteners, hardware, and off the shelf parts used in the machine’s mechanical build- all of these have been provided in the kit.\nThe 3d models are already in the preferred orientation for printing, so you only need to make sure they’re placed within the build volume when slicing.\nOptional Parts There are some parts in the Bill of Materials page that are highlighted and flagged as optional. These prints are not necessary to print - feel free to print them if you think they’ll be useful for you, but they aren’t required for building the machine. There are notes in the BOM about what extra parts and steps are necessary to use them.\nNext steps Start by assembling the belt tensioners.\n","categories":"","description":"Printing all the parts necessary for the build\n","excerpt":"Printing all the parts necessary for the build\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/printing-parts/","tags":"","title":"Printing Parts"},{"body":"Alright, time to get into the build! First, we’re going to build the belt tensioners that are used for the X and Y axes. You need to build three of these.\n   Qty Part     1 each, 3 total M3 Hex Nut   1 each, 3 total M3x16 machine screw   1 each, 3 total M3 Cap Nut   1 each, 3 total M5x25 machine screw   1 each, 3 total M5 Nyloc Hex Nut   1 each, 3 total M5x40 machine screw   1 each, 3 total M5 Hex Nut   1 each, 3 total GT2 Pulley Idler   1 each, 3 total FDM-0037 (Belt Tension Arm)   1 FDM-0001 (Front Left Leg)   1 FDM-0002 (Front Right Leg)   1 FDM-0013 (X Idler Mount)    Assembling the Belt Tensioner Arms     Insert an M3 Hex Nut into its slot on the back of a Belt Tension Arm.     Insert an M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the Belt Tension Arm and then tighten.     Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.     Insert an M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the Belt Tension Arm so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler.     Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.     Repeat this two more times so that you have a total of three arms.\n  Attaching a tensioner to the left side Now you’ll attach the first tensioner to the Front Left Leg:\n Insert an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the Front Left Leg.     Insert a completed Belt Tension Arm  assembly between the arms on the Front Left Leg, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.     Insert an M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tightens into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.       Attaching a tensioner to the right side Next, attach the second tensioner the the Front Right Leg. This is nearly identical to the first one:\n Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the Front Right Leg.     Insert a completed Belt Tension Arm assembly between the arms on the Front Right Leg, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.     Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not over-tighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.       Attaching a tensioner to the X idler mount The third and final tensioner is attached to the X Idler Mount. This is only slightly different from the previous two:\n Insert the M5 Nyloc hex nut into the recess on the bottom of the X Idler Mount.     Insert the completed Belt Tension Arm into its slot in the X Idler Mount.     Insert the M5x40mm machine screw through the hole in the top of the X Idler Mount so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tightens into the Nyloc Hex Nut.

Now we’ve got OpenPnP installed on your computer, and we’ve got the default configuration loaded up, our next step is getting connected to the machine using OpenPnP and getting familiar with the UI.\n Connect your machine to your computer using the included USB-C cable, and open OpenPnP on your computer. You should now see the OpenPnP UI:    Com Port and Baud Rate Before connecting to the machine, you need to set which USB ports to use for communication in OpenPnP.\n  Click on the Machine Setup tab     Click on the “Expand” checkbox to open all of the features about your machine.     Under Drivers click on GcodeDriver GcodeDriver     Below the list of machine settings you’ll find the details of the GcodeDriver. In the Configuration tab, check the Baud and Port settings.\n The Baud should be 115200 On Windows, the Port should be in the format: COM2. On Mac, the Port should be in the format: cu.usbmodem\u003ca-lot-of-numbers\u003e On Linux, the Port should be in the format: ttyACM0. (If no options show, your LumenPnP may not be plugged in correctly, or not powered on correctly, or need to have it’s firmware updated).       Bottom Camera Config Now we’ll set up the cameras. The big red “X” in the camera views means that OpenPnP doesn’t know where to find the webcam feed. OpenPnP needs to know which webcam is which.\nCamera Connection Issues While the LumenPnP motherboard does have a built in USB hub and USB ports for you to plug the two webcams into, this arrangement may not be compatible with your computer. Some computers use higher quality USB hubs, which can handle the bandwidth required to stream video from both webcams at once over a single USB port. From reports we’ve gotten from users, it seems that many computer manufactures do not include good enough USB hubs. In these cases, one or both of the USB webcams will fail to show up in the configuration list below. If this is the case, you will need to plug at least one of the webcams directly into your computer via a separate USB port. Occasionally this can cause the webcam’s name to be incorrect, but you’ll still be able to select it from the drop-down list with trial and error.

The Camera feeds should update automatically with a very slight delay.     Connecting to the LumenPnP  Click the green power button in the Machine Controls section of the UI to connect to your machine.     The power button should turn red, and OpenPnP has connected to your machine. You should also see both webcam feeds as shown below. (If you don’t see any, or just one, under the Cameras section, select the Show All Horizontal option from the dropdown.)     While homing won’t work properly until you finish calibrating the fiducial locations, you should now be able to manually “jog” your LumenPnP. Select 1mm or 10mm on the Distance slider, and then press the arrow buttons to move each axis of your machine. Again, since the machine isn’t properly homed it may not move all the way to its boundaries. This is simply a test to make sure that OpenPnP can send it Gcode successfully.

The LumenPnP is a robust machine, but it needs both cameras to make sure it can pick and place components reliably every time. Note that these are very important calibration steps, but OpenPnP makes them relatively easy. Certain steps will probably need you to tune them more than once to get them perfect, others should stay mostly constant.\nThe first step, is to correct for the fisheye effect of the webcams to help make sure they can identify distances accurately. This is not a step you will need to re-run unless you replace your webcams. Original OpenPnP documentation for reference..\nBottom Camera Calibration   Click on the Machine Setup tab.

Under Cameras click on OpenPnpCaptureCamera Bottom     In the lower detail pane, switch to the Lens Calibration tab     If necessary, use the Jog commands to move the XY gantry out of the way so you have room above the bottom camera.\n  Tip To see both camera views at the same time, click on the dropdown in the top left of the UI and select “Show All Horizontal”.   Click Start Lens Calibration.     OpenPnP is now looking for the pattern of dots printed on the underside of the datum board. (Depending on how they’re displaced in the image, OpenPnP will correct for lens distortion while the LumenPnP is running.)\n  Hold your datum board under the top camera as shown below. Check the camera view in OpenPnP to move the pattern into focus. If the focal distance is too close such that you can’t get the whole pattern in focus and in the field of view, screw in the lens a few turns and test again. If you’re having trouble adjusting the focus, try using the community-created lens adjustment tool.\n  OpenPnP will flash when it takes an image of the pattern, and will require you to take a few for an accurate calibration. Slowly move the calibration pattern around the camera’s field of view until OpenPnP tells you that it’s gathered enough photos.\n       Tip If you’re having a hard time getting the camera to pick up on the pattern on the datum board, you can always print out the original calibration pattern recommended by OpenPnP, which you can find here.

You’ll start by assembling the left side of the machine as seen from the front:\n  Assembly    Qty Part     1 FDM-0001 (Front Left Leg)   1 FDM-0003 (Back Left Leg)   2 Aluminum extrusions   6 M5 T-slot nut   6 M5x10 machine screw   1 NEMA17 Stepper motor   1 GT2 Pulley (with grub screws)   6 M3x8 machine screw   1 Limit switch PCB   2 M5x25 machine screw   1 FDM-0007 (Frame Umbilical Mount)   1 FDM-0046 (Umbilical Swivel Part 1)   1 FDM-0047 (Umbilical Swivel Part 2)   1 M5x40 machine screw      Take the Front Left Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the holes in which they’re inserted. If you have a hard time getting the extrusion into the slots, gently slide them into place using some taps from a mallet.       Take the Back Left Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Front Left Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.       On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.         On the bottom rail, the outer side has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the Back Left Leg, two on the Front Left Leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.         On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the Back Left Leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.       Slide the GT2 Pulley onto the the motor shaft of a NEMA17 stepper motor with the set screw side facing the motor body. Align the pulley so that the end is roughly flush with the end of motor shaft, then tighten one of the set screws on the pulley into the flat side of the motor shaft. Tighten the second set screw as well.     Mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the Back Left Leg. Attach it using four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.       Mount one of the three limit switches to the Front Left Leg as shown in the image. Use two M3x8mm screws and tap them directly into the print.     Next, we’ll mount the Frame Umbilical Mount. Using two M5x25mm screws, attach it to the Front Left Leg as shown, threading directly into the part.     Lastly, we’ll assemble the umbilical swivel. Swivel Part 1 and Swivel Part 2 fit together as shown below, and are secured in place with a M5x40mm screw and an M5 nut. Tighten so there’s no play in the fit, but the two parts can swivel easily.

It’s important to make sure we’re mounting the motherboard in the correct place on the staging plate so that all the cables fit and reach their respective ports correctly.\n  Put your Lumen up on its haunches and take a look at the left side of the staging plate. We will be working with the following holes on the staging plate: A3, G3, A9, G9.     Pass four M3x10mm screws through the top side of the staging plate, and tighten them into the standoffs.     Now we can mount the motherboard itself. Confirm the orientation of your motherboard so that the USB ports are facing to the left and the vacuum sensors on the bottom.

Note that the whale icon on the motor drivers will be right-side up and the two upward-facing pins will be facing to the left.     Install the four heatsinks on the center of the motor drivers.\n  Note It is very important to not plug in or unplug stepper motor drivers or motors while the board is powered on. Make sure to unplug the power supply before inserting or removing drivers or motors.  Power    Qty Part     1 Power Supply     Cut the barrel connector off the end of the power supply cable.     Separate the two wires and strip off the insulation of each.     Twist the stranded copper and insert the wire with the white text into the positive side of the power screw terminal on the motherboard. Insert the black wire into the other terminal, and screw both down tightly.   Note Do NOT apply solder to the twisted copper wires. This can prevent the wires from being compressed in the screw terminals, meaning uneven electricity and heat distribution and risk damaging your machine. You may use wire crimps if you prefer and have them on hand.    Next, plug in your power brick. Watch for a light by the screw terminal. If you do not see a light, check to make sure you inserted the wires into the correct terminals. Also check to see if the light on the power brick is illuminated. (The color of the light may differ based on which kit you received.)

The one connecting from the front left leg to the left side of the Y gantry is the Y gantry umbilical, and the one connecting from the front left leg to the X gantry is the X gantry umbilical.\nY Gantry Umbilical This cable bundle will contain the following:\n   Qty Part     1 X axis limit switch cable (XL)   1 X axis motor cable (XM)   2 Heatshrink tubing (large)   1150 mm (45 in) Woven sheathing      To begin, we’ll get these two cables laid out at the correct spacing. XL and XM should be perfectly aligned on the label side, no offset.\n  Measure out 1150mm of sheathing and cut it from the rest of the spool.     Take the piece of sheathing and expand it by compressing it. You should find that inserting the two cables at the correct offset will maintain this offset while pushing the sheathing over them. Follow the pictures below for a good method of pushing the cables through the sheathing. If it starts to fray a little bit, don’t worry! This is purely a cosmetic step; you can trim off any frayed bits and use the heatshrink to clean up the ends.         Push the sheathing up until there’s equal amount of exposed black cable of the shorter cable, as shown below.     With the sheathing an equal distance from the closest connector on each side, slide two pieces of heatshrink tubing over the fraying end of the sheathing, with equal amounts on the cables and on the sheathing. This is to hold the sheathing in place, keep it from fraying, and generally making it look nicer. Use a heat gun or lighter to heat the heatshrink tight onto the cable.

Having these spaced correctly ensures that every cable reaches every plug with strain relief and length for movement. Use the image below to make the correct spacing.     Once you have the spacing correct, use a short zip tie to hold them together at this spacing to preserve it while sheathing.       Now, cut a 1475mm piece of sheathing from the remainder and expand it by compressing it.

The datum board is a reference point for everything else you’ll do with the machine. The center dot of the datum board will be the most important calibration point for the machine. It’ll be used to fine-tune the LumenPnP’s XY position after homing to account for any errors in the limit switches.\n  Use four M3x16mm screws and four M3 nuts to secure the datum board and datum board mount to the staging plate on the rear of the bottom camera, through holes: B18, A19, A21, B22. The the fisheye calibration pattern should be facing down, and the gold grid of lines and fiducial in the center of the Opulo logo facing upwards. Tighten this down securely.     In the “Machine Controls” pane in the lower left, connect to the LumenPnP if you haven’t already by pressing the power button.\n  Run a rough home routine by pressing the Home button (shaped like a house). The machine will move to the X and Y axis limit switches. The default machine configuration files are set so that OpenPnP will not try to use the homing fiducial yet. Note that the home icon will turn yellow, as the LumenPnP has homed to it’s end stops, but hasn’t completed its full homing routine.     Tuning the Homing Fiducial  Click on the Machine Setup tab in the top right pane.     Click on the “Expand” checkbox to open all of the features about your machine.     Under Heads, click on ReferenceHead H1     In the bottom right details pane, you’ll be looking at the Configuration Tab. Change the Homing Method to ResetToFiducialLocation. This will set OpenPnP to use the top camera to look for the homing fiducial to more precisely home the XY gantry, instead of only using the limit switches.     Click Apply to save this change.     Click on the “Position Camera over location” icon button show below. This will move the top camera to approximately where your datum board is mounted.     In the bottom left Machine Controls pane, Select the Actuators tab.     Toggle on the LED ring lights by pressing the LED button.     If the fiducial board is not in focus, rotate the Top Camera lens until the board is sharply in focus.     Tip Right click on the camera feed to change the Reticle style to see the center of the camera image. You can also use the scroll wheel to zoom in on the feed for more precision.\n   Go back to the Jog tab in the “Machine Controls” pane.    Set the Distance slider to 0.1 for more precise movements.    Manually jog the head so that the reticle in the center of the Top Camera feed in your top camera view is perfectly centered on the Homing Fiducial in the center of the Opulo logo.     Check Camera Exposure Double-check your camera’s exposure. If it needs adjustment follow the steps in this section:\n Navigate to the Machine Setup tab     Click the “Expand” checkbox if necessary     Navigate to Heads \u003e ReferenceHead H1 \u003e Cameras \u003e OpenPnPCaptureCamera Top     In the lower detail pane, switch to the Device Settings tab     Scroll down if necessary to the Properties list of adjustments for the camera image.     In most cases you can simply check the Auto checkbox for Exposure, then uncheck it to save the automatically set value. Note that this may not work in all situations, so you may need to manually adjust the image settings to get a clear image, where the Homing Fiducial is clearly distinguished against the background o the datum board.     For Mac Users Due to an issue with the camera driver in OpenPnP, some Mac users might notice that the image settings are greyed out for you. There’s a fantastic open-source application called CameraController that can be used to edit these settings!  Apply Homing Fiducial Changes  Double-check that:\n The Homing Fiducial is in the center of the reticle in the camera feed The camera image is in sharp focus The camera image is properly exposed    Go back to Machine Setup and select Heads \u003e ReferenceHead H1.     Click on the “Capture Location” icon button to save the location where OpenPnP will start searching for the Homing Fiducial.     Click Apply to save your changes.     Click on the “Home” button in the Machine Controls Pane \u003e Jog Tab and watch your machine home using the limit switches, then move the top camera over the homing fiducial and find its exact location.\n  Troubleshooting: Vision Pipeline Adjustment  If you find that the machine is having a hard time finding the homing fiducial, you might need to edit the Vision Pipeline for it. You can do that by going to the Machine Setup tab, and selecting Fiducial Locator under Vision. Click the Edit button to adjust the computer vision settings.     There is quite a bit to tuning a vision pipeline, and you should take a look at the OpenPnP documentation. But there are a few things you can pretty easily tweak to get up and running. First, let’s check out what the vision pipeline thinks it’s seeing. In the window that just popped up, click on the row with “DrawCircles” in the Stage column. The image will show you every circle detected from the pipeline, as shown below. If there is more than one, or if the one shown is not perfectly hugging the fiducial, there are tweaks to be made. The image below shows a correctly tuned pipeline, with a single circle encircling the fiducial.\n    The first variable to address is the threshold value. To access these settings, click on the row with “Threshold” under the Stage column. If the threshold is too low, then we won’t be isolating the area around the fiducial enough. A too low of a threshold value will look like the image below:    Raise the value until the fiducial is a clean, solid circle, as shown below:\n  Next, we can check and see how many circles the pipeline is finding. We want it to only be finding one, and have it hug the fiducial exactly. Click on the row with “DetectCirclesHough” in the Stage column. In the image below, you can see from the list in the bottom right that two circles have been detected. We can solve this by adjusting “param2” and bumping the value up. The lower the value, the more circles are detected. If the diameter of the circles detected is incorrect, adjust the maxDiameter and minDiameter settings.    With a higher value in the “param2” field, we only detect a single circle.\n  Lastly, you can confirm that the changes result in accurate fiducial detection. Once again click on the row with “DrawCircles” in the Stage column. The image will show you every circle detected from the pipeline. Confirm there is only one, and it is perfectly hugging the fiducial as shown below.     Exit out of the pipeline editing UI, save your changes, and try to home again. With your vision pipeline tuned, the machine should find the homing fiducial on your machine and center the crosshairs of the top camera on it.\n  It is likely that the machine will move to the wrong place and not be able to identify the homing fiducial. If this happens, OpenPnP will give an error popup that says FIDUCIAL-HOME no matches found. This is normal, as it means you’ll need to fine-tune the location that OpenPnP moves the LumenPnP to in order to find the homing fiducial. You’ll also note that the home icon will turn yellow, as the LumenPnP has homed to the end stops, but hasn’t completed the full homing routine.     Note If you’re lucky, your machine may succeed at finding the homing fiducial on the very first try. In that case, the homing procedure will continue, and will try to detect a nozzle on your toolhead. This will fail, and you will receive the error: Nozzle tip calibration: too many vision misdetects. Check pipeline and threshold. This is normal, and you can skip the rest of this page and go onto MM/Pixel calibration.

This will make sure the machine can correctly home and prevent damage. For each of the three limit switches on the machine, tap the switch closed and watch for a red LED to light up on the limit switch PCB. If all three do, proceed with motor movement testing. If not, double check your limit switch connections.\nManually home the machine One more step before having the machine move: manually move the the machine’s head to the lower left corner of the machine. Don’t move it completely into the limit switches, leave a few centimeters of space.\n  Doing this makes sure that the machine head does not crash into the build plate during the homing and motor tests.\nHome each axis individually Now you’re ready to test the machine’s motion. You’ll do this one axis at a time to limit any possible damage due to motion issues.\nYou’ll start with the Z axis (the nozzle head). Send the following lines of Gcode one-by-one:\nG91 ; absolute positioning G28 Z ; home the Z axis The Z axis should move to the limit switch and then back off. If it doesn’t, make sure you have the motor cable for the Z axis connected correctly at both the motherboard and the motor.\nBefore continuing, move the Z axis to “safe” Z, which prevents it from colliding with the staging plate:\nG0 Z 31; Move the Z axis to safe Z Next, you’ll home the X axis. Send the following Gcode:\nG28 X; The machine’s head should move to the left, touch the limit switch, and back off. If it doesn’t, double check the X axis motor’s connection.\nIf the X axis homes correctly, you’re ready to home the Y axis:\nG28 Y; The machine’s head should move to the front of the machine, touch the limit switch, and back off. If it doesn’t move correctly, double check that you soldered the Y2 connector opposite of the silkscreen as noted in the motherboard section.\nIf the X, Y, and Z axis all moved and homed correctly, excellent! If not, reach out to us for assistance.\nNozzle rotation Next we’ll check the left nozzle rotation stepper motor:\nG0 A90 You should see your nozzle stepper rotate 90 degrees.

If you’re absolutely sure that ABM is the way to go, do this:\n Boot your motherboard into DFU Mode  Press and hold the BOOT button Press the Reset button and hold for 10 seconds Release the Reset button and wait for 10 seconds Release the BOOT button      Now, press the upload button in ABM as shown below:    Wait for the process to finish Continue with step 11   Manually Configuring PlatformIO (for flashing via PIO)   Download the latest Marlin firmware and unzip it.\n  Install VSCode and its PlatformIO extension\n  Open Marlin firmware’s folder on VSCode\n  Grab Marlin configuration files (Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h) and replace the files in the Marlin/Marlin folder with those new ones.\n  Edit the platformio.ini file to indicate which board you’re uploading to. Update default_envs to read Index_Mobo_Rev03.     Attach the LumenPnP Mobo to your computer with the USB cable.\n  Boot your motherboard into DFU Mode\n Press and hold the BOOT button Press the Reset button and hold for 10 seconds Release the Reset button and wait for 10 seconds Release the BOOT button       NOTE If you have a hard time getting your board to enter DFU mode, instead try powering off the machine entirely, holding the ‘BOOT’ button, plugging in power, waiting 10 seconds, then release the BOOT button.   Upload firmware to the board via PlatformIO:     Wait for the process to finish:     Press Reset on the board, or power-cycle the machine after the flashing is completed. Now it should show up as a COM/Serial Port on your PC:\n   Windows:    Mac/Linux:     Flashing Factory Firmware If you’ve put new firmware on your motherboard, but just want to get back to the firmware that your machine was flashed with, check the release for your build number and download the .bin firmware file attached to it. Put your board into DFU mode as described above, connect to your computer, and flash the binary to the board using the following command:\n`dfu-util -d 0x0483:0xdf11 -s 0x08000000:leave -a 0 -D ~/path/to/firmware.bin` Once flashing is completed, the machine should automatically exit DFU mode, and be accessible to OpenPNP again. For more information see Step 9 of the update firmware guide.\nTroubleshooting If you aren’t able to upload, you can check to see if your motherboard is booting into DFU mode correctly:\n  Windows:     Mac/Linux:     Also, reference the Marlin instructions for uploading. Be sure to use bugfix-2.1.x if uploading using these instructions.\nAlternative Method (Not Recommended) This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent). Additionally you need the software STM32CubeProgrammer by ST. This method is a bit more involved and takes longer than just using the DFU mode.\n  Compile (build) the project normally with PIO\n  This generates a .bin-file that contains the firmware\n  Connect your board to your ST-Link through the SWD header on board\n  Start STM32CubeProgrammer\n  Connect to the MCU:     Click on Open file and navigate to the firmware.bin file in PROJECT_DIRECTORY/.pio/build/STM32F407VE_black     Click on Download. This will flash the SMT32F4 with the provided firmware     Done! Now you just have to disconnect the ST-Link and press the reset button on the board.\n  Next steps Continue to wiring and pneumatics.\n","categories":"","description":"Flash Marlin onto the motherboard.\n","excerpt":"Flash Marlin onto the motherboard.\n","ref":"/docs/motherboard/update-firmware/","tags":"","title":"Update the Firmware"},{"body":"Summary This section is all about plugging stuff in!

Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X idler assembly to the right side gantry body. Note that orientation does matter here: the head of the machine screw that holds the idler should be visible when looking down at the top of the machine, and the chamfers on the X Idler Mount line up with the ones on the Y Gantry.       Using four M5x25mm machine screws, attach the X Motor Mount and Y Gantry Umbilical Mount to the left side gantry assembly. The motor should be on top with the pulley facing downwards.

Some people’s sensors can detect a swing of about 200, but in some cases there isn’t enough of a difference for a useful signal because of some part tolerances. We’re sorry about this! When the community discovered this issue, we stopped shipping immediately and designed a board that sits in between the vacuum sensor and the motherboard that makes the signal much stronger. Once we confirmed this board fixes the issue, we installed them on all machines we shipped moving forward.\nNo Interposers Installed\n  Interposer Boards Installed\n  If you bought a LumenPnP kit that did not come with interposer boards installed and would like to upgrade them, please reach out to our support team and we’ll get some sent out to you as soon as possible. We have an installation guide to guide you through the process.\nIf you have the interposer boards installed for your vacuum sensors, change the G4 to a G2 in your “sensor read” GCode command. This changes the gain of the sensor to a more usable value. The difference in value should now be about 2000.\n It’s also worth noting the command for reading the second vacuum sensor.

Depending on your kit, these could be metal clips or rubber stoppers inserted through the rail. Take care not to accidentally slide the bearings off of the linear rails after removing the stoppers. The bearings will be properly blocked from being removed after the linear rails are attached to the X Gantry Front and the Z-axis limit switch is installed.\n  Place the two linear rails onto the front of the X Gantry Front and line up each one with the arrays of three holes on the left and right side. Place three M3x14mm machine screws into each of the rails (the holes on the ends first, then hole one in the middle) and tighten down.     Place the NEMA 17 motor so the shaft runs through the X Gantry Front and emerges on the same side as the linear rails. Make sure the motor’s connector is pointing towards the umbilical guide as shown below. Use using four M3x8mm machine screws to fasten the NEMA17 motor to the X Gantry Front.       Attach the limit switch PCB with two M3x8mm screws at the top right of the X Gantry Front.     Slide a GT2 idler onto a M5x25mm machine screw. Thread that assembly through X Gantry Front and tighten on the Nyloc Hex Nut on the back side. Ensure that the fit is tight and there’s no wiggle in the idler, but also make sure that it can spin freely and isn’t seizing from over-tightening.

Each gantry comes in two parts. The first is a back plate that sits against the linear rail carriage, and connects to the timing belt, called Left Z Gantry Backplate and Right Z Gantry Backplate. These will always be on your machine. Even when you swap toolheads, these will stay attached to the linear rail.\n First, we need to get the GT2 timing belt inserted into the back plates at the right spacing. Insert the end of your GT2 belt halfway along the slot in the Right Z Gantry Backplate. Then slide the belt into the slot in the Left Z Gantry Backplate with 108mm of belt between them (when measuring from the edges of the prints). Your setup should look like the image below:     Now, cut the loose end of the belt such that there is 114mm remaining when measured from the edge of the print. Insert this loose end into the other backplate so that there are no empty teeth.\n    Slide the GT2 Pulley onto the Z axis motor’s shaft, with the set screws closer to the motor body. Don’t tighten the set screws yet. Place backplate and belt assembly on linear rails, threading the belt through the pulley on the stepper motor. Ensure that the back plates are oriented as shown in the image below.    Insert M5x40mm bolt with GT2 idler into bottom of plate, and thread the belt around it. Secure backplates temporarily with two M3x8mm bolts as shown below.     Slide the Z motor up in its hardware slots and check for belt tension. If you’re able to get the belt completely taut, great! If not, remove a loose end of the belt, snip off a belt rib from one side, reinsert, and try again. As long as you are able to get the belt taught from the movement of the stepper motor, you’re good to move on.\n  While pulling upward on the Z stepper motor so that the belt is tesioned, tighten the four M3 bolts holding it to the X gantry.\n    Finally, attach the left and right Z gantries to the back plates using M3x8mm bolts as shown below.

Take your NEMA11 hollow shaft stepper motor and place it in the left Z gantry. Secure it in place with four M2.5x8mm screws. Make sure the wire port is facing outwards as shown below.     Now we’ll mount a few bits of hardware to the hollow shaft motor. Screw the CP40 nozzle holder into the bottom side of the motor, and screw the press-fit pneumatic coupler into the top side.     Use four M5x10mm screws to loosely attach two of your Belt Clamps onto the X Gantry Back.

The off-center port is the one that provides vacuum. Start by cutting a 65mm section of the 6mm clear tubing and pushing it onto the off-center port on the vacuum pump. Push the other end onto the inline plastic port of the valve as shown below.        Cut a 230mm section of the 6mm clear tubing and push it onto the right-angle plastic port of the valve, and push the other side into the single, larger port of the Y splitter.       Switch to using the smaller, 4mm black tubing. Cut a 235mm length of 4mm OD tubing and push one side into a fork of the Y splitter, and route the other end underneath the motherboard and onto the VAC1 sensor port. Keep In Mind This sensor is only attached to the motherboard with six solder joints. Be gentle when pushing the tubing onto it. Twisting the tubing back and forth as you push it down can help get it on without too much force.        Plumbing the X gantry  Now take the remaining length of 4mm black tubing and push it into the other fork of the Y splitter. Take the loose end, and route it underneath the motherboard, then up through all the zip ties that are holding the X umbilical in place, including those along the swivel arm.     Now that the pneumatics are also routed, we can finally tighten the zip ties on the umbilical cable guide. While your machine is still back on its haunches, tighten the zip tie on the umbilical guide to secure the wires and tubing to the frame.\n  Bring your LumenPnP down onto its four legs, and tighten the zip ties, ensuring to keep a bit of slack between sections. You can move up the umbilical swivel and tighten all the zip ties along the whole thing.\n  With the pneumatic tubing dangling loose past the end of the swivel arm, cut any excess tubing (still allowing some slack for motor rotation) push the other end into the pneumatic coupling on the back side of the rotation stepper motor. Extra slack will allow the motor to rotate freely 180 degrees in each direction, so err on the side of leaving more than less. If the tubing falls away from the umbilical, use one or two small zip ties to secure them together.   The bottom of the staging plate should look like the image below:     Congratulations, you’re all wired and plumbed up!

You’ve got your homing fiducial all set up, and have played around with tweaking a vision pipeline. This next step calibrates the relationship between pixels and millimeters to make our cameras more accurate.\n  First, let’s calibrate the top camera. Jog the camera over to your datum board. Select your machine’s head in the Machine Setup tab, and click the icon highlighted below to move there. There are some markers on the datum board that will help us do this exact calibration.     Select your top camera in the device tree. Under the General Configuration tab, scroll down to Units Per Pixel. Under the X and Y Object Dimensions, type in the number 5.\n    Now, zoom out on the camera and jog to one of the golden squares on the datum board. Make sure the entire square is visible in the camera’s field of view like the image below.    Then click the Measure button. A box with drag handles will appear in the camera viewfinder. Drag the box so that it lines up with the golden box on the datum board; they are exactly 5mm x 5mm. Make sure that you are aligning the bounding box with the center of the golden lines as shown in the image below. Once you have it perfectly outlined, click Confirm. New numbers should populate the Units per Pixel fields, but they should be relatively close to what you found in there to begin with. Then hit Apply.     To confirm, jog around by clicking on various locations on your datum board in the top camera viewfinder and see how accurate the centerpoint of the camera view gets to where you clicked. If it’s inaccurate, try doing the calibration again or tweaking the values in the fields.\n  Now we’ll calibrate the bottom camera. For this, we’ll use a nozzle tip! Put an N24 nozzle on the CP40 Holder, and under your bottom camera’s settings in the device tree, under the Position tab, click the icon with the red nozzle in the blue circle (Hover text says “Position the tool over the center of the location”). This should move your nozzle over the camera. Don’t worry if it’s not exactly centered; we’ll fix this in a later step. It’s important you don’t try to fix this now. Manually jog it over the center of your bottom camera by clicking on the bottom camera viewfinder. If your lens is not focused on the nozzle tip, you should rotate the lens so that the nozzle tip is sharp and clear.\n    Now, do the same calibration that you did for the top camera, but instead of inputting 5 in the X and Y fields, input 4. Drag your bounding box around the nozzle tip so that it’s perfectly tangent to the edges, and press Confirm. Your pixels per millimeter are now calibrated!

Make sure the X motor is on the left side with the front of the X gantry facing you. Note You’ll find that it’s hard to fit the X gantry onto the rail. This is because of a few protrusions on the back plate that hold the belt at the right distance. Loosening the M5x40mm bolts holding the two halves of the X gantry together will help it slot onto the rail.      Prepare two V-slot rollers. You may need to align one or both of the interior washers inside the rollers, as they can shift in shipping and block the hole for the screw. Simply push the washers back into place with a screwdriver tip.\n  With the top roller bolts still loose, slide the two X Gantry Tension Bars onto the bottom of the X Gantry prints. Slide two rollers in between them, ensuring that the holes in them line up with the holes in the X Gantry Tension Bars.       Now we can secure the stack in place using two M5x40mm bolts. Pass them through the holes, and loosely tighten them into two M5 nuts in the slots on the X Gantry Back. Don’t tighten all the way yet; we still have some adjustment to do first.         Tighten the top roller bolts now that everything is in its place.     Now we add tension screws. These are what hold the X Gantry Tension Bars in the correct position to have proper tension along the rail. Take four M3x30mm screws and pass them through the holes in the X Gantry Tension Bars, and thread into the M3 nuts inserted into the X Gantry prints, as shown below. Make sure each screw is tightened the same amount, and that the X gantry can still move freely, but doesn’t have any wiggle on the rail.       Tighten the M5x40mm bolts that run through the bottom set of rollers (installed in the previously) so that their position is locked.     Camera and Ring Light    Qty Part     1 USB Camera (Top)   1 FDM-0015 (Top Light Mount)   1 FDM-0014 (Top Camera Mount)   1 Top Ring Light PCB   4 M2.5x20 machine screw   2 M3x14 machine screw   1 Super Lube    Note There’s a piece of black electrical tape on the back of the camera PCB. Don’t remove it; it is there to help isolate the camera sensor from light shining through vias in the PCB.   Before mounting the camera, you’ll need to make sure you can rotate the lens and adjust the camera’s focus. First carefully remove the set screw on the side of the lens assembly that is holding the lens in place. Next, unscrew the lens from the camera. You might need a light grip with pliers (preferably with soft grips) to get it to turn. With the lens removed, use a cotton swab to apply a very small amount of Super Lube to the lens threads. Be careful not to get any of the lubricant inside or on the lens. Wipe off any excess with a cotton swab or microfiber cloth. If necessary, you can clean the lens itself using a microfiber cloth. Screw the lens back into the camera and work the lubricant into the threads. Save the lubricant as you’ll use it again later. Finally, add the set screw back to the side of the lens assembly. Tighten the set screw just enough to keep the lens in place but not so much that it prevents you from adjusting the lens with a little force, as you’ll need to adjust the lens after the camera is mounted.\n  Place the ring light facing downwards into the Top Light Mount. The LEDs will shine down, and the white plastic wire connector will face upwards.       Place the Top Camera Mount on top of the Top Light Mount ensuring that the tab from the Top Light Mount fits onto the side opposite the arms on the Top Camera Mount. These two prints will pinch the top ring light in place.     Install the Top Camera into the Top Camera Mount. Make sure the connector on the back side of the camera is between the two arms of the Top Camera Mount.       Secure the whole stack in place with four M2.5x20mm screws in the outer four holes (not the ones with a metal circle around them). Tighten them down so that all parts are tightly held together, but don’t over-torque; these screws are threading into the plastic of the Top Light Mount.     Use two M3x14mm screws to mount the Top Camera and Light subassembly onto the back of the X Gantry Back.     Next steps Continue to mounting the Y Gantry to the Frame.\n","categories":"","description":"Attaching the X gantry to the Y gantry\n","excerpt":"Attaching the X gantry to the Y gantry\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/mount-x-to-y/","tags":"","title":"Mounting the X Gantry to the Y Gantry"},{"body":"Now we can have OpenPnP run its automatic backlash compensation routine to make all head movements more accurate. Read the OpenPnP docs page about this step here.\n  First, we’ll select the axis we want to calibrate backlash compensation for. Under the Machine Setup tab, select ReferenceControllerAxis x under Axis. Then select the Backlash Compensation tab.     Next, click the Calibrate now button. The machine will go through a long routine (between 5-15 minutes) where it measures the machine’s backlash, and determines the best settings to account for it.\n  When it’s done, you’ll see the output data from the calibration. We suggest selecting OneSidedOptimizedPositioning for the Compensation Method, but experiment with the different options to see which gives you the best results.     Perform steps 1 - 3 but with the Y axis instead.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Calibrating Backlash Compensation\n","excerpt":"Calibrating Backlash Compensation\n","ref":"/openpnp/calibration/backlash-compensation/","tags":"","title":"Backlash Compensation"},{"body":"Now the whole XY gantry assembly gets dropped onto the frame!\n   Qty Part     2 M5x40 machine screw   4 FDM-0009 (Roller spacer)   2 V-slot roller wheel   2 M5 Hex Nut   4 M5 T-slot nuts   1 Staging Plate      Loosen the four M5x40mm screws holding the two halves of the Y Gantries together.     Loosen the two M5x10mm screws that hold the Y Gantries to the X extrusion. Double-check that none of the captive nuts in either of the Y Gantries have fallen out, since they’ll be difficult to reinsert after the next step.     Slot the entire XY gantry assembly onto the top extrusions of the frame. Make sure the X motor is on the left of the machine.       Re-tighten the four M5x40mm screws holding the two halves of the Y Gantries together.     We’ll add an additional roller to each Y Gantry assembly below the extrusions of the frame. Push a M5x40mm machine screw through the Y Gantry, then add on a Roller Spacer, a V-Slot roller, and then another Roller Spacer. Secure the assembly in place with an M5 nut slotting into the Y Gantry Support and threading into the screw. Note: you may need to align one or both of the interior washers inside the rollers, as they can shift in shipping and block the hole for the screw. Simply push the washers back into place with a screwdriver tip.     Now roll the entire Gantry Assembly to the very front of the machine. Adjust the fit of the X axis extrusion inside the Y Gantries so that the top rollers fit perfectly into the v-slot. After you adjust them, tighten both M5x10mm screws that hold the Y Gantries to the X axis extrusion.       Now we need to make sure this spacing doesn’t just work for the front of the machine, but for the entire length of it as well. Loosen the machine screws connecting the back rail to the left and right side. While applying light pressure down on the Y gantry, roll it to the back of the machine. You might find that you need to expand or contract the back legs to have the rollers ride perfectly in the v-slot. Once you have the correct spacing, tighten the bolts mounting the back rail. This locks in the Y gantry extrusion spacing for the back of the machine as well. We also recommend measuring the spacing between the rails in the front and back of the machine, and adjusting until they’re the same.       Use four Slot Nuts and four M5x8mm screws to loosely secure the Staging Plate to the frame. If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, the coordinate A1 is in the front left of the machine.     If you purchased additional staging plates, loosely secure them next to your first staging plate with four Slot Nuts and four M5x8mm screws.     Adjust the Staging Plate so that it is exactly 95mm away from the Front Left Leg and Front Right Leg, then tighten it into place. This will be important for using the OpenPnP configuration provided for the machine. See below for how to measure the distance properly.     Tighten the four M3x16mm screws, two on either Y Gantry assembly, so that the lower rollers are snug against the extrusion and ensure that the top rollers run well in their slots, too. Make sure that there’s no play or wiggle in the fit, but don’t over-tighten to the point of increasing resistance to rolling. The gantry should move easily, but not loosely.     Lastly, tighten the bolts that run through the bottom rollers to lock in the tension setting.\n  Next steps Continue to attaching the belts.\n","categories":"","description":"Mounting the Y Gantry subassembly to the frame of the machine\n","excerpt":"Mounting the Y Gantry subassembly to the frame of the machine\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/mount-y-to-frame/","tags":"","title":"Mounting the Y Gantry to the Frame"},{"body":"Now we need to tell OpenPnP how far the nozzle is away from the center point of the top camera. OpenPnP has a built in “wizard” to help set this offset, so we’ll use that to help us do it. You can read the OpenPnP docs about this step here.\nNOTE: OpenPnP has some new methods of calibration using a secondary fiducial at a different Z height, and a small piece of paper. If you’d like to explore this method of calibration, you can find the OpenPnP docs about this process here. This process requires making and installing a calibration rig, 3D Units per Pixel calibration, and Advanced Camera Calibration.\n Select your nozzle in the device tree, and click on the Offset Wizard menu option. Leave the Include Z? box unchecked. Read the instructions that OpenPnP provides in this window.     You can follow OpenPnP’s instructions using putty or flour, or you can use your homing fiducial. The rest of this page explains how to do this process with your homing fiducial.\n  Using an N045 nozzle tip, jog the nozzle so that it is just barely touching the datum board, and perfectly centered over the homing fiducial. We recommend looking for the shiny edge of the gold fiducial poking out from under the nozzle tip to determine if you’ve centered it correctly.\n       Now, click the Store nozzle mark position button.    It’s important that you don’t navigate away from the nozzle menu in the device tree during this; it’ll wipe your stored nozzle mark position. Now, jog the nozzle up, and jog the top camera to the homing fiducial. Center it exactly on the fiducial, and click the Calculate nozzle offset button. Hit the Apply button in the bottom right. You’ve now stored the nozzle offset!

If you’d like to precut your belt instead of routing the entirety of it through the machine, you can cut two 1400mm lengths for the Y axis motors. To help guide the belt through the openings in the prints, bend it backwards as shown below so that the belt has a curve to it.       Take your length of GT2 belt and stick it inside the extrusion (smooth side facing outward), behind the Y Gantry as shown below. Getting the belt to come out of the slot in the Y axis gantry can be difficult. Try using a small allen wrench with a ball tip to guide the belt out of the hole. Or, attach a twist tie to the end of the belt and guide that out the hole instead. When you’re done, the belt should be coming out of the hole on the side closest to the front of the machine.           Using 4 M5x10mm machine screws and 2 Belt Clamps on the Y Gantry, slide the belt underneath the Belt Clamps and tighten them down with the GT2 belt flush with the edge of the Y Gantry.\n  Now, take the other end of your belt and feed it through the Front Right Leg. Guide it through and around the idler in the Belt Tension Arm, and feed it back through the other side of the Front Right Leg as shown below.       Continue to feed your belt along the inner side of the aluminum extrusion. Pass behind the Y Gantry Support—between it and the aluminum extrusion.\n  Feed the belt through the inner side of the Back Right Leg. Then loop the belt around the GT2 pulley on the stepper motor and feed it through the outer side of the Back Right Leg.     Run the belt along the outer side of the aluminum extrusion. Take the end and feed it through the other opening of the Y gantry, like we did in step 1. Feed the end between the Y gantry and the Belt Clamps. Make sure the belt tensioner on the front leg is completely unscrewed, meaning it’s angled as close to the leg as it can be. This will give us the most possible stroke to tension the belt in the next step.\n  Pull on the belt with one hand, while holding the Y gantry steady with the other. Getting it generally taught is preferable, but don’t worry about getting it perfect; we’ll tension it correctly next. Push down on the belt clamp to hold the belt in place, and tighten the two screws to clamp it down. Cut the belt with at least 20mm remaining out the back side of the Y gantry.\n  Now we can tension the belt. Slowly tighten in the M3 screw on the belt tensioner to increase the belt tension. Pulling back on the belt tensioner arm should be difficult, but possible. A tug should result in only a 2mm deflection.\n  Perform the same steps on the left side Y axis.     We’re going to do the exact same operation for the X axis, but with one small thing to keep in mind: when looking at the back of the machine, start by clamping the belt on the right side of the X gantry (the side closest to the motor). This way, the excess belt will be sticking out of the X gantry on the side opposite of the limit switch, and prevent a problem with homing. You can precut a 1500mm strip of belt for the X axis or just use the rest of your belt and trim the excess.     Next steps Continue to populating the staging plate.\n","categories":"","description":"Attaching and tensioning belts for the X and Y gantries\n","excerpt":"Attaching and tensioning belts for the X and Y gantries\n","ref":"/docs/mechanical-assembly/attaching-belts/","tags":"","title":"Attaching Belts"},{"body":"Now that we know the offset from the top camera to the nozzle, we can use the nozzle to set our bottom camera position.\n Select the bottom camera in the device tree. Click on the Position menu tab. Click on the icon with the red nozzle in blue circle (shown below) to jog the nozzle to the bottom camera position.    The nozzle will now move to be pretty close to the bottom camera inspection location, but it likely won’t be exact. It’s also possible that the tip of the nozzle is not in focus from the fisheye calibration step; adjust the bottom camera focus by turning the lens until the nozzle tip is sharp and in focus.    Tip You’ll notice that the Z height of the bottom camera position is at 61mm. That’s the height that we lift the nozzle to for vision operations so that we can get larger components into the field of view. 61mm is not hard-coded anywhere; you can make it a smaller number if you don’t need bottom vision on larger parts that require a bigger field of view. Just make sure that your bottom camera’s focus matches the Z height of your bottom camera position, and you’re all set.   Jog the nozzle to be perfectly centered over the bottom camera, and click on the blue nozzle icon to capture the position (see image below). Your bottom camera position is now saved!

You can always have OpenPnP prompt you to do this manually, but there’s a feature for automatic nozzle swapping that can just do it for you! In this optional step, we’ll set it up. Perform the following steps for each of the nozzle tips you’d like to enable it for. We recommend reading the OpenPnP Wiki page about this as well. Before starting, put the labeled nozzle tips into the holder in their respective labeled slots. Also make sure to lubricate the end of your nozzle holder with the lubrication packet included with your nozzles. It helps to insert the nozzle holder into all of the nozzle tips multiple times in order to break in the rubber O-rings, and lubricate the inside of the nozzle tips.\n  Select the nozzle tip you’re setting up under the Nozzle Tips menu in the device tree. Select the Tool Changer tab.\n  Now we can start capturing positions. The way automatic nozzle changing works is by replaying four position commands either forward or backward, to either load or unload a nozzle tip, respectively. We’re going to start with the last position, because it’s easiest for getting our Z height correct.\n  Jog your nozzle with the relevant nozzle tip loaded to just in front of your nozzle rack, in front of the slot for that nozzle tip. Adjust the Z height until it’s clear it’ll slide into the rack. Also ensure that it’s aligned in the Y axis so that only a X movement would be necessary to slot it into place. Capture the nozzle position for the Last Location.\n  Now we’re going to slowly jog the nozzle tip into the nozzle rack. Make sure you’re only jogging in the X axis for a clean action. Jog by increments of 0.1mm until you see the nozzle tip pop completely into place. Try to ensure there’s no lateral strain on the nozzle holder. If there is, we’ll see this in a later step and can correct it then. Capture the Third Location nozzle position.\n  The next position is for making sure that the nozzle tip is completely seated on the CP40 holder during insertion. Jog the Z axis down two millimeters. This is not a hard and fast value, if you find that a larger or smaller value gets the nozzle tip seated completely, feel free to use that value instead. The spring in the CP40 holder will take up these few millimeters. Capture the Second Location nozzle position.\n  Now jog the Z axis up 30 millimeters. This is the clearance position where the nozzle holder is getting ready for the plunge. Capture the First Location nozzle position.\n  You can now play through the positions by clicking on the “move nozzle to position” buttons in order. Tune any values in the fields as necessary to ensure you get a clean and straight insertion.\n  Now that your positions are set, you can enable automatic tool changing in OpenPnP.\n  If you’d like to clone these positions for every nozzle tip in the rack, you can use the “Cloning Settings” section in the OpenPnP docs to help you.\n  ","categories":"","description":"Calibrating automatic toolchanger movements\n","excerpt":"Calibrating automatic toolchanger movements\n","ref":"/openpnp/calibration/auto-toolchanger/","tags":"","title":"Automatic Toolchanger Calibration"},{"body":"We now have the main structure of the machine assembled!

If your pump is not pre-soldered, follow along here to prepare your pump.\n  Gather your Pump, the pump wire (labeled “P1”), and two lengths of heatshrink.     Slip the heatshrink over the two exposed leads of the wire.     Wrap the red wire around the left lead as shown in the image below. Wrap the black wire around the right lead.     Solder both wires to the pump leads. The polarity does not matter.     Slip the heat shrink over the solder joints and motor lead. Use a hot air gun, lighter, or other heat source to shrink the heatshrink.       Pump mount    Qty Part     1 FDM-0025 (Pump Mount)   4 M3 Hex Nuts   2 Rubber Band   1 Vacuum Pump   2 M3x10 machine screw    The first thing we’ll mount to the staging plate is the Pump Mount. This print suspends the pump using two rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.\n Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the side recesses in the Pump Mount.     Now we’ll mount the pump in the Pump Mount using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.         Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the Pump Mount. Guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it’s suspended in the Pump Mount.         Mount the Pump Mount to the staging plate using two M3 x 10mm screws in the location shown below, F31 and F33.       Valve mount    Qty Part     1 FDM-0042 (Valve Mount)   1 Blowoff Valve   4 M3 Hex Nut   6 M3x8 machine screw    Now we’ll attach the Valve Mount to the staging plate.\n Press fit four M3 nuts into the recesses in the Valve Mount.     Use two M3x8mm screws to attach the valve to the Valve Mount as shown below.     Use four M3x8mm screws to mount the Valve Mount to the staging plate in the location shown: E23, E25, G23, G25.       Pneumatic Y splitter mount    Qty Part     1 M3x30 machine screw   1 M3 Hex nut   1 Y Splitter     Use an M3x30mm screw and an M3 nut to mount the pneumatic Y splitter to the staging plate as shown: B12.

Stack the Up Camera Mount Up Light Mount     Just as with the top camera, you need to make sure you can rotate the camera’s lens to adjust its focus. First carefully remove the set screw on the side of the lens assembly that is holding the lens in place. Next, unscrew the lens from the camera. You might need a light grip with pliers (preferably with soft grips) to get it to turn. With the lens removed, use a cotton swab to apply a very small amount of Super Lube to the lens threads. Be careful not to get any of the lubricant inside or on the lens. Wipe off any excess with a cotton swab or microfiber cloth. If necessary, you can clean the lens itself using a microfiber cloth. Screw the lens back into the camera and work the lubricant into the threads. Save the lubricant as you’ll use it again later. Finally, add the set screw back to the side of the lens assembly. Tighten the set screw just enough to keep the lens in place but not so much that it prevents you from adjusting the lens with a little force, as you’ll need to adjust the lens after the camera is mounted.\n  Stack the Up Camera in the Up Camera Mount. The cable connector for the camera should be as close to the cable connector for the Up Ring Light as possible, as pictured below.       Use four M2.5x8mm screws to mount the camera into the Up Camera Mount by using the inner set of four holes and tapping directly into the plastic.     If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, you’ll need to install a support foot to keep the staging plate sturdy. Stack the Foot Mount on top of the assembly. If you have the metal staging plate, you can skip this step.     If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, push four M3 nuts into the recesses in the Foot Mount.     Use four M3x30mm screws and four M3 nuts mount the whole assembly to the staging plate: D18, B20, D20, F22 (if you have the fiberglass staging plate, these will be the nuts you installed in the previous step). The cable connector for the Up Ring Light should be facing down and to the left, away from the valve.       Ensure that your bottom camera matches the orientation to the image below.       If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, note that this is where the foot will get installed when your LumenPnP is ready.
